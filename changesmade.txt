GEGL Effects continual version is a branch of GEGL Effects that will be conintually updated with stable releases, but new releases
may break the users text style presets. I am doing my best to make sure every official build on Github is 100% suitable for work.
So users will always be free to use a previous stable version that has all their text presets. 


GEGL Effects continual edition's progress

 
..March 26 to March 29 2023..

GEGL Effects was given the ability to bevel its outline, add an image file overlay to the outline and hue rotate said image file overlay.

..March 30 2023 build..

Outline now has a checkbox to fix a visual bug in which even when outlines are at 0% opacity the color selected with faintly display around edge pixels. 

GEGL Effects received new blend modes for its bevel. (hard light, color dodge and alternative grain merge blend modes) Stroke Outline a bug where 100 shadow opacity crashed Gimp.

..March 31st 2023 build..

Same as March 30th except a major crash fix but happened. The crash appears to be caused by drop shadows opacity going up to 1.00 so it was limited to 0.990 and that solved it.
Drop Shadow's "blur radius" slider use to show up to 300, now it only shows up to 110, but will be able to go up to 300 or higher if the user wants.


..March 31st 2023 build 2..

The same day GEGL Effects and zzstrokebevelimage was recompiled. Parameters of sstrokebevelimage AKA the outline was changed to lock its offset at (-15-15)

The operation 'gegl:opacity' was deemed to  be the culprit in crashes and GEGL Effects was instructed to make its outline and shadow both max out at (0.999) as opposed to the previously even 1. 
This prevents crashes. The "gegl:opacity" inside GEGL inner glow still goes up to 2. so it may or may not have issues.

It seems there is a fundemental problem with the operation GEGL Opacity that I am not able to resolve as all I do is rearrange GEGL Nodes not code math that modifies pixels. 

Any presets that use drop shadow or stroke on 1 may not load so one will have to resave the preset at 0.999 (which is basically the same thing).

The March 31st 2023 build 2 may be the first build fit to put on Github.
